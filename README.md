This lab couples two coastal models: CoastSat and Coastal Evolution Model (CEM)

We use CoastSat to download and extract shorelines from satellite imagery.
These shorelines feed into the CEM where they are evolved by historical wave characteristics.

We also use functions developed by nickc1 to download NDBC buoy data - see https://github.com/nickc1/buoypy
